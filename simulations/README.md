# Debug:
    # Check how I compute Q_d: should probably include the toll
    # Understand the issue with welfare calculations

# To do - linear model :
    # Do the linear model with analytic solutions
        # Compute welfare loss as a share of income (with and without recycling, with and without pollution)
        # Check whether optimality conditions may hold with A negative
    # Test different mechanisms:
        # Subsidy
        # Subsidy financed by a toll
        # Quantity-based regulation
        # To what extent PT infrastructures should be improved (gamma reduced) for a total switch to PT being welfare improving?
    # For each scenario, analyze welfare:
        # Compute optimal policy
        # Compute policy that improves the welfare of the largest number of people
        # Try to derive some conclusions
        

# To do - non-linear models :
    # Improve congestion functions (3)
    # Try to better match EGT statistics (2)
    # Try to better match distribution of incomes (1)
    # Try to plot effect of policies (4)
    # Go to a stochastic set-up (5)
    # Add pollution exposure (6)
