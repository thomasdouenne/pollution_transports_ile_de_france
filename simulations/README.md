# Debug:
    # Check effect on welfare is correct (look at low income hh, the graph does not make much sense to me)


# To do - most urgent things
    # Set identical parameter values everywhere
    # Account for pollution in all scripts
    # To compute optimal policy, maximize welfare change (similar to diff in log utility)


# To do - linear model :
    # Test different mechanisms:
        # * Subsidy / toll without recycling and without pollution
        # * With revenue-recycling
        # * With pollution-externality
        # * Subsidy financed by a toll
        # * When there are home-owners
        # * Quantity-based regulation
        # To what extent PT infrastructures should be improved (gamma reduced) for a total switch to PT being welfare improving?
    # For each scenario, analyze welfare:
        # Compute gains and losses
        # Compute optimal policy
        # Compute policy that improves the welfare of the largest number of people
        # Try to derive some conclusions


# To do - non-linear models :
    # Improve congestion functions (3)
    # Try to better match EGT statistics (2)
    # Try to better match distribution of incomes (1)
    # Try to plot effect of policies (4)
    # Go to a stochastic set-up (5)
    # Add pollution exposure (6)


# Organization of the scripts:
